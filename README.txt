GP2Team3_HWG_Prototype_GP: Contains the Gameplay Prototype for Group 3 in Project 2

The GP2Team3_HWG_Prototype_GP folder contains a early playable version of our game. This playable build includes Player and Camera movement, pickup of our McGuffin object, as well as functionality that only allows victory when the object is collected. The game also features two types of enemies. The first enemy type is vision based, and will only chase the player if they are within line-of-sight. The other will chase the player for the entirety of the game, and can shoot and defeat the player if they get too far.

(The McGuffin is in the first building to your left, past the vision-based enemy)
